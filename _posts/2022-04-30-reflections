###Digital Humanities
As a Digital Humanities minor, I have previously taken classes on this field of study. Therefore, I already had background knowledge on the subject prior to taking this class. At the beginning of this semester, I wrote my own definition on Digital Humanities. I wrote “Digital Humanities is the adding of the digital element to enhance our understanding and research on humanities.” As I am finishing the course, my definition remains the same. All assignments, readings, and research that we did during the semester reiterated my initial interpretation of the Digital Humanities field. They also furthered my understanding on the subject matter.


###Readings
All assigned readings throughout the semester were necessary and helpful for the class. If I missed a reading assignment, I would feel lost or confused the following class period as each reading was applicable to every project. They provided resources to inspire new ideas on what to write, improve what we already wrote, or explain how to approach a topic. I always found myself going back to certain readings to check if I was on the right track. Although certain readings were more dense than others, all were vital to supplement understanding on the course. A few notable readings that I found interesting were “Text Scanning Patterns: Eyetracking Evidence” and “Sh***y First Drafts.” 
####Text Scanning Patterns: Eyetracking Evidence
This article was helpful because I learned how the website design affects how readers consume information. In fact, I identified as the “Layered Cake” pattern when reading for academics or just for fun. I applied what I learned from the article to my web design class when creating a website. I wanted my website to be visually appealing and not overwhelming to read any information. Not only was I able to capture the interest of readers for my website, but I was able to do so on the blogs and other projects in this course.
####Sh***y First Drafts
Typically, I struggle to start writing my papers due to my unrealistic desire to be perfect. This unnecessary pressure makes me self-conscious about my writing, especially when sharing my works with others. Thankfully, this article boosted my confidence when approaching my assignments. It taught me that first drafts are not meant to be perfect. In fact, it is acceptable for them to be bad. The flexibility that a first draft has for brainstorming allows for experimentation with any potential ideas. Overall, it was relieving to learn that all writers, whether professional or not, go through this process of having a “sh***y first draft.”
