# Hello! Hello! Hello!

### My name is Hana Lee Todhunter!  
I am a junior at [Christopher Newport University](www.cnu.edu)  majoring in Communication with minors in Theater and Digital Humanities. Although I was born in Hanau, Germany, (where I got my name: "Hana" from **Hana**u) Yorktown, Virginia is my home. My family moved here over 18 years ago so this area is all I’ve ever known. Since I live 20 minutes from school, I commute to campus which is what my parents did when they went here _waaaaay_ back in the 80s when CNU was still a college.  

I recently started interning with [Virginia Creative Group](https://virginiacreativegroup.com/) where I help with marketing for medical practices. Hopefully I will be able to work for this company full-time for a few years after I graduate. Eventually I would like to be a flight attendant for American Airlines throughout my 20s and later become a real estate agent when I want to "settle down." The spontaneous adventures that the career as a flight attendant would offer excite me as I love traveling and there are so many places in the world I hope to visit.  I also enjoy looking at houses and watching any show on HGTV which has inspired my desire to do real estate.  

Social media and technology are going to play a big role in the future, so I think the skills I will learn from this class and minor would be helpful to have regardless of any future job career. Although I would not describe myself as “tech-savvy,” I am a part of the generation that grew up with social media and the internet so I can say that I at least know a thing or two when it comes to these topics...but there’s always room for improvement and I look forward to seeing what else I can learn in the Digital Humanities field. However, at the end of the day I would much rather hang out and make memories with those I love face-to-face than sit in front of a computer screen.  

I enjoy theater as I have participated in various plays and musicals throughout middle and high school. I think it would be fun to continue to audition for theatrical gigs in the community sometime in the future. Currently, I am involved in a co-ed service fraternity, [Alpha Phi Omega](https://apo.org/). The people I have met in APO are truly welcoming, kind, and passionate about helping the community which is what encouraged me to join. I am also involved in a school ministry known as [Christian Students Fellowship](https://www.instagram.com/csfcnu/?hl=en). We have weekly Bible studies and almost every Sunday, we have Family Gathering where we eat dinner and play games together. Lastly, I work in the school mailroom. Every shift is surprisingly a humorous yet entertaining experience as I have witnessed numerous strange packages shipped to our school. _(One time someone shipped a PB&J sandwich in a simple plastic bag!)_  

If you see me on campus, feel free to say hi! And if not, no worries. You’ll be **_guaranteed_** to hear me shouting your name from across the Great Lawn regardless of how far away you are! :)
